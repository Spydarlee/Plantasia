# Plantasia
Plantasia is a small game about cultivating your very own plant-covered island paradise! Take a small, barren island floating in space and fill it with wondrous flora! Explore the universe to discover new species and help them grow. The game is available (for free) on Windows, Mac and Linux via [itch.io](https://karnbianco.itch.io/plantasia) and Android devices via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KarnBianco.Plantasia).

This repository contains all the custom source code and assets that make up the Plantasia Unity project. Most of these are in the [Source folder](UnityProjects/Plantasia/Packages/Source) which lives in the Unity Assets folder when the project is put together with Projeny (see [below](#project-setup)). And 'raw' content, such as Blender files and vector graphics that aren't used in-game directly, can be found in the [Content folder](Content).

 Unless otherwise noted (in the [Credits section](#credits)) all code and assets are dedicated to the public domain via the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), which means you're free to use them for any purpose! No warranty is implied, though, so use at your own risk. No need to credit me if you use anything either, although it's always appreciated!

 ## Project Setup

Plantasia uses [Projeny](https://github.com/modesttree/Projeny), a tool for managing Unity projects and packages. Various assets from the Unity asset store which cannot be uploded to GitHub for licensing reasons, are referenced as Projeny packages in [ProjenyProject.yaml](UnityProjects/Plantasia/ProjenyProject.yaml). If you want to build Plantasia yourself you'll need to ensure these dependencies are also on your system. 

I can write more detailed instructions about this if anyone needs them - let me now!
